**Problem Statement**

Insurance companies need to accurately predict the cost of health insurance for individuals to set premiums appropriately. However, traditional methods of cost prediction often rely on broad actuarial tables and historical averages, which may not account for the nuanced differences among individuals. By leveraging machine learning techniques, insurers can predict more accurately the insurance costs tailored to individual profiles, leading to more competitive pricing and better risk management.

**Insurance Cost Prediction need**

The primary need for this project arises from the challenges insurers face in pricing policies accurately while remaining competitive in the market. Inaccurate predictions can lead to losses for insurers and unfairly high premiums for policyholders. By implementing a machine learning model, insurers can:
Enhance Precision in Pricing: Use individual data points to determine premiums that reflect actual risk more closely than generic estimates.
Increase Competitiveness: Offer rates that are attractive to consumers while ensuring that the pricing is sustainable for the insurer.
Improve Customer Satisfaction: Fair and transparent pricing based on personal health data can increase trust and satisfaction among policyholders.
Enable Personalized Offerings: Create customized insurance packages based on predicted costs, which can cater more directly to the needs and preferences of individuals.
Risk Assessment: Insurers can use the model to refine their risk assessment processes, identifying key factors that influence costs most significantly.
Policy Development: The insights gained from the model can inform the development of new insurance products or adjustments to existing ones.
Strategic Decision Making: Predictive analytics can aid in broader strategic decisions, such as entering new markets or adjusting policy terms based on risk predictions.
Customer Engagement: Insights from the model can be used in customer engagement initiatives, such as personalized marketing and tailored advice for policyholders

# Project Summary
**This project aims to predict medical insurance premiums based on various factors, such as age, BMI, gender, and lifestyle indicators. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we visualized relationships between features to identify influential factors. After pre-processing the data and splitting it into training and test sets, we tested several machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, to find the best predictive model.**

**Results:
The Random Forest yielded an accuracy score of 92% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting insurance premiums. This model could be further improved by adding more feature engineering or using advanced algorithms for enhanced precision.**
